There was once a wolf who had been raised to be a herbivore. 
Every day, it ate berries until a horde of evil bunnies invaded its home. 
Without his hunger for meat, the bunnies were not afraid of the wolf and 
instead ganged up on him. Until the wolf had had enough of being a herbivore 
and decided to embark on a new adventure as a carnivore. 
Consuming meat and strengthening its resolve to assassinate anyone who gets in its way.
