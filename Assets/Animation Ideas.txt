Wolf Fades Away - Pairs with the "Perish" SFX
Bunny Fades Away - Have a generalized death style. 

But bunny will turn into a bone first before perishing similar to the Ghosts. 
- Also seems more natural to turn it into a bone. 

Wolf Eat and Close. Quite similar to Pac-Man. 
- Rotate Wolf to face the direction it is going towards.

Bunny split into 3 types: Normal, Panic/Scared, Recover
- Each one will rotate to face the direction it is moving towards
- Normal has no animation while moving, similar to the game. 
- Panic has no animation while moving too but eyes are now blue in color. 
- Recover flashes for a few times using opacity. 

Only the berry will flash. Other fruits/meat won't.
