BGM:
: Beginning of each game 
     - The floor is paused for a few seconds to let the song play before starting
     - Spook4 opening

: When enemies are in normal state
     - This will remain playing during the entire game unless in panic state
     - Foam Rubber in normal pace

: When enemies are in panic state
     - This will lasts only for the duration of the panic state/buff 
     - Foam Rubber in faster pace (signify panic)

: When player 'kills/eats' an enemy
     - This will lasts for 1-2 seconds after eating the enemy
     - It will override the panic state bgm during this duration
     - Spook4, somewhere in between, there is an ending-like song

: When player is consuming pellets/points 
     - Only when player has consume a point, each point triggers the SFX once

     - Custom Sound: KnockWall.wav

     - End SFX (Die SFX) not the outro song
